Project Euler Problem #6:
	The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is: (1^2) + (2^2) + ... + (10^2) = 385
	The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is: (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
	Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
	Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

My Solution:
	I extended this problem to a more general approach. The code below will find the difference between the sum of the squares
	and the square of the sum of the first N natural numbers.

	Luckily enough we do not have to iterate through a loop to find the sums. The formulas for a given N are given as:
		\sum_{i=1}^N i = (N(N+1))/2
		\sum_{i=1}^N i^2 = (N(N+1)(2N+1))/6
